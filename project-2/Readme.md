## Udacity SQL Nanodegree

### Unit 2: Management of Relational and Non-relational Databases

## Project 2: Udiddit, a Social News Aggregator

This is project 2 of the Udacity SQL Nanodegree, completed in August 2022.

### Introduction

Udiddit is a social news aggregator, content rating, and discussions website. On Udiddit, registered users are able to link to external content or post their own text content about various topics. In turn, other users can comment on these posts, and each user is allowed to cast a vote about each post, either in an up (like) or down (dislike) direction.
Unfortunately, due to some time constraints before the initial launch of the site, the data model stored in Postgres hasn’t been well thought out, and is starting to show its flaws.
You’ve been brought in for two reasons: 
-	make an assessment of the situation and take steps to fix all the issues with the current data model;
-	improve the current system by making it more robust and adding some web analytics.

### Tasks

Udacity provided a template with all the tasks to be completed and where to record the SQL code used. The template contains the following sections: 
•	Part I: Investigate the existing schema
•	Part II: Create the DDL for your new schema
•	Part III: Migrate the provided data
